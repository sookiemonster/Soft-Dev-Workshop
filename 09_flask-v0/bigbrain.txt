K09: Simple Path to Greatness - Details the answers to questions on app.py 
2021-10-04

Q0: 
Before & After:
We’ve seen similar syntax in Java where you would set 
a variable to an instance of an object. Also, just in 
general it’s similar to setting variables equal to 
function return values. 

Q1:
Before & After:
The meaning of '/' might have to do with directories 
and paths to directories, especially since the format 
of the path to a directory consists of slashes. 
Furthermore, `@app.route()` indicates a path to a 
location because of the word “route.” This could 
specify the path of the page in relation to the site 
(so like pages.html/).

Q2:
Before:
It won’t print out anywhere. 
After:
This will print to the command prompt / terminal that’s 
used to run the app when the page is accessed.

Q3:
Before: 
It will print the name of the function surrounded 
by two underscores on each side.It will print "__hello_world__".

After: 
It’ll print “__main__” if the app.py is specifically 
being run or “app” if it’s run via “flask run” command. 
This only prints in the terminal after opening the link 
“http://127.0.0.1:5000/”. 

Q3: 
Before:
This will not appear anywhere because it just returns, 
not prints, "No hablo queso!".

After:
This’ll appear on the page that comes up when you run 
the flask file and open the 127.0.0.1 local page by 
opening the link “http://127.0.0.1:5000/”. This’ll be 
run when 127.0.0.1 is opened, as that directs the traffic 
to “/” which in turn calls the hello_world function, 
which’ll return “No hablo queso!” as text on the site.

Q5:
Before & After:
It kind of reminds us of methods in Java, in which 
certain methods appear in this format. For example, 
a simple one is `list.size()`.
