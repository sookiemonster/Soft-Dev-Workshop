K09: Simple Path to Greatness - Details the answers to questions on app.py 
2021-10-04

Q0: 
We’ve seen similar syntax in Java where you would set a 
variable to an instance of an object. Also, just in general 
it’s similar to setting variables equal to function return values. 

Q1:
The meaning of '/' might have to do with directories and paths 
to directories, especially since the format of the path to a 
directory consists of slashes. Furthermore, `@app.route()` 
indicates a path to a location because of the word “route.” 
This could specify the path of the page in relation to the site 
(so like pages.html/)

Q2:
This will print to the command prompt / terminal that’s used 
to run the app. 

Q3:
It’ll print “__main__” if the app.py is specifically being 
run or “app” if it’s run via “flask run” command.

Q3: 
This’ll appear on the page that comes up when you run the flask 
file and open the 127.0.0.1 local page. This’ll be run when 
127.0.0.1 is opened, as that directs the traffic to “/” which 
in turn calls the hello_world function, which’ll return 
“No hablo queso” on the site.

Q5:
It kind of reminds me of methods in Java, in which certain
 methods appear in this format. For example, a simple one 
 is `list.size()`.
