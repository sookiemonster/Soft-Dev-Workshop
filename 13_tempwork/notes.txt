EGO:
- programmers have a certain ego to their work, and thusly create a negative environment for themselves in the effort of trying to prove that their work reflects them
- Bill G. prospered as a programmer because he was able to accept error in his code from his peers as genuine help instead of a personal attack
- most programmers work alone, mainly to keep code errors at a minimum
