K23 - Building a Foundation

Time Elapsed: 1 hour

DISCO: One big discovery was the fact that Foundation and Bootstrap both utilize a class-based approach
towards styling html elements. An earlier discovery with Bootstrap was the fact that one could give an
HTML element multiple classes by putting spaces between class names in the value for the class attribute.

QCC:
Foundation appears to be lighter than Bootstrap to load, but with lesser features. I will say that the
documentation for Bootstrap is more appealing and easier to read than with Foundation.

I do not like the video based approach foundation tries to put onto readers of its website. I prefer snappier,
concise explanations of code, like Bootstrap's documentation has.

Q0: I had to use the foundation documentation extensively. The on-ramp page
of my neighboring duo, though pleasant to look at, did not include the code they
used to construct the features they had on their page.
Bootstrap Documentation: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/

As for verbal consultations, we had our neighboring duo talk in-brief about the usage
 of cards in their site, but that was all.

Q1: Personally, I prefer Bootstrap. The class names are easier to understand, and there doesn't 
seem to be as many custom attributes (if any at all). I also found Foundation to be relatively
convoluted to understand; the grid system didn't make as much sense as Bootstrap's. Furthermore, 
the Bootstrap aesthetic is, in my opinion, better than that of Foundation. The typography is overall
more clean (eg. font family is nicer, more variation with header types like "display").
